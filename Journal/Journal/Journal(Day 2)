	We decided that our game needs a Main Class, Player Class and Interface, Enemy Class and Interface, Map Class,
Food Class and Interface. The Main Class will run the game, the Player Class will create the player, the Player Interface will 
have the methods getPlayerPosition(), canEat(), the Enemy Class will create the Enemies, the Enemy Interface will have 
the methods isEaten(), backToBase(), the Map Class will generate it's own map, the Food Class will create Food, and the 
Food Interface will have the methods increasePoints(), isAPowerUp(). We will create these basic classes and interfaces 
first for the foundation of our game, and later make improvements.
	The both of us will work on the Main Class and the Map Class. I will be responsible for the Player Class, Player
Interface, Food Class, and Food Interface. Risa will be responsible for the Enemy Class and Interface, and later an
additional class we will use to improve the game.
