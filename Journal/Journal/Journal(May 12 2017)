Day 7

	I forgot we couldn't display GIF files, so right now i'm working on getting the Player to be able to switch back and
forth between two images when it touches another object. I think we did this before, so I will reference back to the
classwork. I will continue working on this at home. My goal is to be able to code the additional stuff next week.
