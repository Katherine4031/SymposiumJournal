Day 8

	Today was a semi-productive day. I don't understand why keyPressed() wasn't working even though it did last Friday.
We created the field gameStart = false, and then changed it to true in initObjects(), but after testing it out some more
we found out that gameStart is not actually being changed. So instead of initializing gameStart as false, we just
created gameStart, left it as true in initObjects(), and it worked.
	Tomorrow I hope to get more done, because I have problems managing time.
