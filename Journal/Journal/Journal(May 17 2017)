Day 10

	We got the player to display and move continuously in the direction the arrow is pressed. We also got the enemy to 
continuously to chase after the player. We still need to code the part when the enemy touches the player and the player 
did not eat a power up, then it would be game over; or the player did eat a power up and the enemy disappears. I will 
finish coding the food class after we create the map, because I need to figure out the layout to display the food.
	We will start making the map tomorrow.
