Day 6

	We will most likely be done with the Player Class/Interface, Food Class/Interface, and Enemy Class/Interface by
tomorrow. We don't know why the display is not working, so we will fix that tomorrow as well. 
	I also decided to have an arrayList of player names and high scores, and for the power up food to be able to 
disappear or swap places with normal food.
