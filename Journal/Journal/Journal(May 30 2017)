Day 15

	We paused off on creating the map for now. We think it would be better to check that we are adding the right 
coordinates to the ArrayList by testing if the player passes the borders that we set. It's kind of confusing because on
the game we created it starts at (20, 40) but on the Map (20, 40) is the starting point (0,0).
