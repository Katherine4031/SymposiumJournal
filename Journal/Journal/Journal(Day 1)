	Today I spent the period deciding whether or not to join the same group as I did the last project or work
in pairs with Risa. After debating if I would be able to show improvement in terms of the project they planned to do and 
other factors, Risa and I decided to work in pairs. We thought of making a game like PacMan but of course we'll add extra 
components. Tomorrow we will talk about the presentation and decide the parts we need and who will code what.If we have 
time, we might start coding.
