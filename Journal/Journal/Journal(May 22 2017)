Day 11

	We were thinking of using 2DGraphics to create walls to create one set Map. The coordinates of each wall will be 
stored in 2D Array so we can make sure the player does not pass through those walls. We don't want to hard code it
repetitively so we are trying to see if we can create an algorithm?
